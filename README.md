# Shogi (Japanese Chess)
One of the four projects that we were assigned during our OOP course at ITU taught by Mr. Sarfraz Raza.

## Instructions for developers:
### Dependencies:
* SFML 2.5.x
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
* C++ 20

## Note:
* The release mode for msvc fails in optimizing the game and generates machine code that causes the game to crash. This however, is not the case with debug mode so for now on, compile the game using debug mode (performance is still good enough)
* Only 1920x1080 resolution is supported for now.
## Instructions for players:
* After entering each name, press enter or else it won't proceed. Only after pressing enter after entering the second player's name, you may press new or load game buttons
* Standard Shogi rules apply, you can read about them here: [shogi-rules](https://www.shogi.cz/en/rules)
* I haven't added the option to save a game from inside so to load a custom state of the game, you have to manually modify the load file. I do plan to add this feature in the future though.
